# JustaFantasyAddon
A vanilla+ styled mod in development for Fabric 1.19.2+ Features are on the side of fantasy/ realism with some creative liberties being taken. The code style is awful. As the mod progresses, more interactions between modded items and vanilla will be added, like a desert ecosystem with scorpions, and moving away from merely imitating vanilla items. New gameplay mechanics will soon be added. This document is NOT optimised for viewing on mobile screens. Each item is added under the philosophy that it should add a new feature to the sandbox and offer a new way for the player to interact with the world, one block at a time.

There is a large portion of assets and code taken directly from other projects, artwork and some code must be redone in order to publish this mod.
